                        One of the founding and leading members of the famous band Led Zeppelin is naturally third on our list of the top 10 best guitarists on the planet.
                        Known as “The Wizard,” Page is a guitarist like no other, playing with a violin bow on his famous Gibson, alternating blues and rock with joy and passion.

                        <p>The music that Jimmy Page made was able to transport you so that you got lost in what he was playing. His solos were show-stopping and so innovative when it came to guitar-playing technique at the time. He set himself the challenge of breaking the preconceptions of what a guitar can do, so his style evolved over time. But he was always one of the greats, even when experimenting!</p>
